Dimagi's Research and Data (RAD) team is inviting you to participate in some exploratory pilot work to inform the
development of chatbot initiatives the team is planning to pursue. We will be asking you to: 


1. Complete a brief survey with demographic questions and experience with chatbots
2. Test at least one chatbot 
3. Complete a survey to provide feedback on your experience

Expected time to complete these tasks will be a minimum of **XX** minutes
(time may vary depending on the number of chatbots you test). 

Your participation is completely voluntary, and you may choose to stop participating at any time without penalty.
You may not receive any direct benefits from participating; however, your responses may help us learn more about
how to better design our chatbots and related future studies.
Participation involves risks to confidentiality similar to a person’s everyday use of the internet in that there
is always a risk of breach of confidentiality.
However, every precaution will be taken to minimize this risk.
Your responses will be accessible only by the RAD team, and any data will be reported anonymously.

If you have any questions or concerns about your participation, please contact the RAD team at
[rad@dimagi.com](mailto:rad@dimagi.com) or leave a message at 617-649-2214 ext. 506. 

Please indicate whether you would like to participate. Selecting “I Agree” indicates that: 

* You have read and understand the above information
* You voluntarily agree to participate
* You are 18 years or older
